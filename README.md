# blind-maze
### by far my one of the hardest project yet, not the cool menu, not the player movements and collisions, but the maze algorithm. Yeah it took me a while to figure out, it's not 100% accurate still, but it's playable. If you can do better than me, please go ahead, I'm still very new at this.
